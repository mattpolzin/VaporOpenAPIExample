# VaporOpenAPIExample

This example shows off an early stage project to both add type information to Vapor requests/responses and also take advantage of that information to generate OpenAPI documentation.

Note that this app and the libraries it showcases are built off of Vapor's upcoming version 4 release.

The example app serves up OpenAPI documentation on itself using the beautiful Redoc viewer.
